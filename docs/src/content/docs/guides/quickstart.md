description: 'Install Fireside, run the demo, and present your first deck in a few minutes.'

This page is the fastest path from nothing installed to a deck on screen. It
assumes no protocol knowledge — if you want to understand *why* Fireside is
shaped the way it is, [Mental models](/spec/mental-models/) is the next stop
after this.

## Requirements

The presenter renders with 24-bit RGB colors and has no 256-color fallback,
so you'll need a truecolor terminal (most modern terminal emulators; set
`COLORTERM=truecolor` if colors look off). It also expects a monospace font
with Unicode box-drawing support, and is most comfortable at ~80 columns by
24 rows or larger — narrower windows still work, but content wraps tighter.

Fireside draws into whatever font size your terminal is already using — it
has no way to set this itself, since font size is the terminal emulator's
setting, not the app's. If you're presenting to an audience (a projector, a
screen share), bump your terminal's font size up *before* you launch
Fireside, the same way you would before opening any other presentation
tool.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tiberius-s/fireside.git
cd fireside
cargo install --path crates/fireside-cli
```

Requires Rust 1.88+ (MSRV).

## See what a deck can do

```bash
fireside demo
```

Press `Space` to move forward, `↑`/`↓` at a branch point to choose, and `?`
any time — the presenter teaches its own keys. `q` quits.

## Make your own

```bash
fireside new my-first-deck
fireside my-first-deck.fireside.json
```

`new` scaffolds a small starter deck; the second command presents it.

## Live-edit while presenting

Decks live-reload while you present: edit the JSON in another window, save,
and the slide on screen updates in place. You can also press `e` during a
presentation to quick-edit the current slide's heading, text, and list
items without leaving the terminal — see [Presenting a deck](/guides/presenting/#quick-editing-a-slide).

## Write in Markdown instead of JSON

Most talks start as an outline, not hand-written JSON:

```bash
fireside import talk.md
fireside talk.fireside.json
```

`import` compiles a Markdown file into a deck — each `##` heading becomes a
node, and a small fence syntax declares branch points. See
[Authoring a Deck in Markdown](/guides/authoring-markdown/) for the full
syntax.

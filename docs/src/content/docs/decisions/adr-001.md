## ADR-001: Why a Graph?

**Status:** Accepted
**Applies to:** Fireside Protocol 0.1.0

### Context

Presentation formats typically use one of three structures: a flat list of
slides, a tree (sections containing slides), or a directed graph. Fireside
needs to support branching paths, audience choices, rejoining after branches,
hub-and-spoke menus, and cycles — none of which are possible in a flat list or
a strict tree.

### Decision

The Fireside document model is a **directed graph** of nodes. Nodes are stored
in an ordered array with implicit sequential edges. Explicit traversal
overrides (`next`, `after`, `branch-point`) add additional edges that can
create branches, rejoins, cycles, and shortcuts.

### Consequences

- **Branches** are first-class: any node can define a `branch-point` with
  multiple options targeting other nodes.
- **Rejoins** are natural: the `after` field creates return edges from branch
  termini back to the main path.
- **Cycles** are permitted: hub-and-spoke patterns use `after` edges that point
  back to the hub node.
- **Linear sequences are a degenerate case**: a graph with no traversal
  overrides is a flat slide deck. Authors pay no complexity cost if they don't
  need branching.
- **Trees can't rejoin**: a tree structure would require duplicating shared
  content at every branch endpoint. A graph avoids this duplication entirely.
- **Validation is harder**: the engine must detect dangling references and
  unreachable nodes. This is a one-time cost at load time.

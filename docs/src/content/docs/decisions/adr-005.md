## ADR-005: Why Explicit Extension Type?

**Status:** Superseded
**Applies to:** Fireside Protocol 0.1.0

### Context

This ADR captured a transition from prefix-based extension naming to explicit
typed extensions. The extension model has since been stabilized and is now
defined normatively in the specification chapters.

### Decision

The protocol moved to explicit extension blocks.

This ADR is now superseded by:

- §5 Extensibility
- §2 Data Model

### Consequences

- Historical rationale remains available for design traceability.
- Normative extension requirements should be read from the specification.
- Further extension-mechanism changes should be recorded in a new ADR.

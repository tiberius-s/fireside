## ADR-006: Why Not Twine/Ink Format?

**Status:** Accepted
**Applies to:** Fireside Protocol 0.1.0

### Context

Twine and Ink are established interactive fiction tools with their own
authoring formats. During the design phase, the question arose: why not adopt
or extend one of these formats instead of creating a new protocol?

### Decision

Fireside defines its own **portable, schema-validated JSON format** rather than
adopting Twine's HTML-based format or Ink's interpreter-dependent markup. Where
applicable, Fireside borrows concepts that proved effective in these systems.

### Consequences

- **Twine is tool-specific**: Twine documents are HTML files with embedded
  passages in `<tw-passagedata>` elements. They depend on a specific story
  format runtime (Harlowe, SugarCube, Chapbook) to function. There is no
  portable, engine-independent representation.
- **Ink is interpreter-dependent**: Ink stories are compiled to a JSON-based
  runtime format, but that format is designed for the Ink runtime's specific
  evaluation model (variable tracking, conditional logic, inline functions).
  It is not a general-purpose content graph.
- **Neither produces portable, schema-validated JSON**: both formats assume a
  specific runtime. Fireside's JSON format can be consumed by any engine that
  implements the traversal contract — terminal, browser, native, or classroom.
- **Best ideas borrowed**: Ink's weave/gather pattern (branching into
  sub-paths that rejoin the main narrative) directly influenced Fireside's
  `after` field for branch return edges. Twine's passage-based authoring
  influenced the node-as-moment metaphor.
- **Format-first approach**: Fireside prioritizes the document format over any
  specific tool or runtime. Authors can use any editor to write JSON (or YAML).
  Tools can be built around the format, not the other way around.

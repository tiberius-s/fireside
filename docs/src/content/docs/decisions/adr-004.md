## ADR-004: Why 7 Core Blocks?

**Status:** Superseded
**Applies to:** Fireside Protocol 0.1.0

### Context

This ADR reflected an intermediate stabilization step while the data model and
extension strategy were still being revised. The final protocol wording now
lives directly in the normative specification chapters.

### Decision

At the time, the protocol maintained a constrained mandatory set to keep engine
implementation complexity low.

This ADR is now superseded by the current definitions in:

- §2 Data Model
- Appendix C — Content Block Reference

### Consequences

- Historical context remains useful for understanding tradeoffs.
- The normative source of truth is now the specification, not this ADR.
- Future block-set changes should be captured in a new ADR that references this
  one as superseded context.

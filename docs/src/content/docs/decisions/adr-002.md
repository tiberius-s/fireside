## ADR-002: Why JSON?

**Status:** Accepted
**Applies to:** Fireside Protocol 0.1.0

### Context

The wire format must be universally parseable, self-describing, and
schema-validatable. Candidates considered: JSON, YAML, TOML, MessagePack,
Protobuf, and custom DSLs.

### Decision

The Fireside wire format is **JSON** with kebab-case property names. JSON
Schema 2020-12 provides the validation layer. TypeSpec generates the canonical
schema files.

### Consequences

- **Richest schema ecosystem**: JSON Schema 2020-12 is the most widely
  supported schema language. Validators exist for every major language.
- **Universal parsing**: every programming language ships with a JSON parser.
  No additional dependencies required.
- **TypeSpec emits natively**: the TypeSpec compiler generates JSON Schema
  directly, keeping the specification and the validation artifacts in sync.
- **YAML as authoring alternative**: YAML is a superset of JSON. Authors who
  prefer YAML can write in YAML and convert to JSON at build time. The protocol
  itself only validates JSON.
- **Verbosity**: JSON is more verbose than binary formats. This is an
  acceptable tradeoff for readability, debuggability, and ecosystem breadth.
- **No comments**: JSON does not support comments. Authors who need inline
  documentation should use YAML or maintain a separate commentary file.

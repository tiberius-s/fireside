# Competitive Analysis (Internal)

## Purpose

This document stores competitive research context for implementation planning.
It is intentionally kept in memory-bank (not user-facing docs) to reduce
documentation noise while preserving design rationale.

## Current Status

- Research has been completed previously across terminal presenters, web slide
  frameworks, interactive lesson platforms, and TUI editor interaction models.
- The implementation direction remains TUI-first: branch UX, editor usability,
  keyboard-first navigation, and polished rendering in terminal constraints.

## Implementation Signals We Keep Using

- Keyboard-first with mouse as optional enhancement.
- Fast edit/present loop is essential for usability.
- Rich branch-selection UX and clear navigation context are differentiators.
- Theme and config experiences should prioritize low-friction defaults and
  predictable precedence.

## Deferred Areas (Current Product Direction)

- HTML/PDF export is deferred.
- Competitive-analysis content remains internal unless explicitly requested for
  public docs publication.

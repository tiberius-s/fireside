# TASK004 - Milestone 4 visual effects

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2026-02-14
**Updated:** 2026-02-14

## Original Request

Implement retro visual differentiators:
ASCII art conversion, pixel-art rendering, and enhanced transitions.

## Thought Process

Milestone 4 builds on Milestone 2 rendering infrastructure. Effects should be
optional and directive-driven so baseline presentations remain fast and stable.

## Implementation Plan

- Add visual-effect dependencies and helpers
- Implement ASCII art renderer
- Implement pixel-art renderer with reduced palettes
- Add enhanced matrix/dissolve/typewriter transitions
- Add title styling enhancements and validate performance

## Progress Tracking

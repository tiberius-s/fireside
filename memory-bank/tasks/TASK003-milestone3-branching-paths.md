# TASK003 - Milestone 3 branching paths

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2026-02-14
**Updated:** 2026-02-14

## Original Request

Implement branching-path navigation as the primary differentiator.

## Thought Process

Branching requires model-level graph semantics and app-level navigation history.
Directive parsing support exists at a foundational level, so Milestone 3 should
focus on full navigation behavior and branch-selection UI.

## Implementation Plan

- Extend slide graph and metadata handling
- Finalize branch directive parsing semantics
- Implement branch selection mode in app state machine
- Add branch-selection UI and overview navigation
- Validate branch backtracking and rejoin behavior

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%

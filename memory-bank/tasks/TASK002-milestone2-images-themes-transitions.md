# TASK002 - Milestone 2 images themes transitions

**Status:** Pending
**Added:** 2026-02-14
**Updated:** 2026-02-14

## Original Request

Implement Milestone 2 visual foundation features:
image rendering, GIF support, transitions, bundled themes, and hot-reload.

## Thought Process

Milestone 2 depends on the MVP pipeline being stable. The implementation should
add rendering capabilities without breaking the parser/model/app boundaries
established in Milestone 1.

## Implementation Plan

- Add image/hot-reload/runtime dependencies
- Implement image and GIF rendering modules
- Implement transition engine and state
- Expand theme system and bundled themes
- Add watch mode and validate with examples

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%

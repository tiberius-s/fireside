# Progress

## Completed

- Protocol baseline normalized to `0.1.0`.
- TypeSpec versioning setup integrated.
- Docs site configured for static output with explicit spec chapter ordering.
- Core model updated to `container` + typed `extension` shape.
- Key spec, guide, schema-reference, ADR, and memory-bank pages updated.
- Root `specs/` quick-reference duplication removed; content moved to
  `docs/src/content/docs/reference/`.

## In Progress

- Bring Rust reference implementation vocabulary fully in line with protocol
  naming where legacy terms remain.

## Known Follow-Up

- Validate generated schema pages and examples against the latest TypeSpec
  output after each protocol model change.
